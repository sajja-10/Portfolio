            <p>
               A boy approached me, a stranger in the night, <br>
               We spent a day together, under the stars' soft light.<br> 
               Together we laughed, in each other's embrace, <br>
               But time led to our separate ways, a cruel case.<br> </p>

            <p>
               Next day, I awoke, and reality did seem,<br> 
               All those memories now adrift in a dream.<br>
               A presence fleeting in this dreamlike space,<br>
               He's in my heart, a face with a gentle grace. <br> </p>

            <p>
             In this unfinished tale, I forever roam, <br>
             Lost in his memory, a place I call home.<br>
             A figure real in a world not quite known, <br>
             His memory's presence, an emotion I own. <br> </p>

            <p>
            He's the missing piece, the one I seek,<br>
            Yet how to find him, the path is still bleak.<br>
            I long for his return, but it remains in vain,<br> 
            The dream lost to me, yet in hope, I remain. <br>  </p>

            <p>
            One day, our memories will come back to life,<br>
            He'll return to my world, like day follows night.<br>
            Dawn won't steal him away, in the morning's light,<br>
            Together we'll be, dancing in love's pure delight.  <br></p>
