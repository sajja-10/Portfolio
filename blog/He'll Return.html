            <p>
               A boy approached me, a stranger in the night, 
               We spent a day together, under the stars' soft light. 
               Together we laughed, in each other's embrace, 
               But time led to our separate ways, a cruel case. </p>

            <p>
               Next day, I awoke, and reality did seem, 
               All those memories now adrift in a dream.
               A presence fleeting in this dreamlike space,
               He's in my heart, a face with a gentle grace.  </p>

            <p>
             In this unfinished tale, I forever roam, 
             Lost in his memory, a place I call home.
             A figure real in a world not quite known, 
             His memory's presence, an emotion I own.  </p>

            <p>
            He's the missing piece, the one I seek,
            Yet how to find him, the path is still bleak.
            I long for his return, but it remains in vain, 
            The dream lost to me, yet in hope, I remain.   </p>

            <p>
            One day, our memories will come back to life,
            He'll return to my world, like day follows night.
            Dawn won't steal him away, in the morning's light,
            Together we'll be, dancing in love's pure delight.  </p>
