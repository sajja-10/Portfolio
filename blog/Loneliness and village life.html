            <p>I found myself in the midst of a soothing rain shower, nestled comfortably in the bed on the ground floor veranda.
                 My mind, usually cluttered with the hustle and bustle of everyday life, had grown still. Worries and anxieties were
                  silenced by the gentle pattering of rain on the tin roof. I was content, basking in the serenity that this sudden downpour
                   had gifted me. It was as though the rain had washed away the noise of the world, leaving behind only the pure essence of the present.</p>

            <p>As I watched the raindrops fall, a sudden realization dawned upon me. I wasn't in a bustling city or a crowded neighborhood; 
                I was in a village. I could see the villagers, a few meters away, doing their work with a spirited determination that the rain
                 couldn't dampen. They were laughing and chatting as they worked, using plastic sheets as makeshift umbrellas, their faces adorned 
                 with the joy of shared labor. Village life, I was watching from my bed, was all about connections and a sense of belongingness. Here, no one was alone. </p>


            <p>In one hand, I had to manage the endless tasks of house building, from dealing with workers to ensuring
                everything was on track. On the other hand, I was expected to
                discover my passions and interests. As if I knew what those were! But fear not, for I found the perfect
                solution: reading books on my Kindle while pretending to supervise
                the workers. Ah, the art of multitasking at its finest! Who needs conventional career paths when you can
                master the intricacies of construction and literature simultaneously?</p>

            <p>Nature itself seemed to be dancing and laughing alongside them, celebrating the resilience and camaraderie of this close-knit community.
                 The rain played its part in this joyful orchestra, turning the mundane into a vivid, beautiful spectacle. People were playfully teasing
                  each other, passing paddy plants across field boundaries, and the air resonated with the lively bethi songs of the village women. From
                   one field to another field, people teasing each other by throwing dirty wet mud to forget about that hasty weather and tiredness was 
                   commendable. Passing paddy plants to different field despite of field boundary and enjoying moments with each other whole day was the 
                   best thing on that day. The loud bethi song by women spreading through the air of my village kept aside the sound of rain for sometimes. </p>

            <p>But even as I marveled at this lively scene, a sense of separation tugged at my heart. I was an observer, a solitary figure
                 in the midst of this vibrant community. Loneliness wrapped itself around me, a reminder that I was still an outsider in this 
                 world. Yet, this feeling of aloneness wasn't unwelcome. It was a gentle reminder that I longed to be a part of this belongingness,
                  to share in the happiness that came from hard work and shared experiences.  </p>

            <p>I took my finger to the rain drop falling from my auntâ€™s tin roof. With the rain still caressing my skin, I suddenly felt an
                 overwhelming urge to join in the celebration. I stepped out into the downpour, and as I did, something magical happened. 
                 I started dancing in the rain, twirling and leaping with an abandon I hadn't felt in years. The raindrops landed softly on my nose, 
                 kissed my lips, and soaked into my clothes. It was as if the heavens themselves were reaching out to touch me. In the solitude of that moment,
                  I felt a deep sense of calm and peace wash over me. </p>
           <p>With the rain as my partner, I twirled and leaped, my heart dancing to the rhythm of the thunder. Each raindrop was a note in a melody 
            only I could hear. I felt complete in that moment, joyous in my solitude. 
            In that moment, I was free and alive. The worries that usually plagued my mind disappeared. 
            Nothing else mattered except the pure joy of the raindrops on my skin and the rhythmic beat of nature's dance. 
            I felt the most beautiful kind of self-love, an affirmation that I could find happiness within myself, even when surrounded by others.  </p>
           <p>I danced and danced, not caring that I was soaked to the bone. It was a dance of liberation, a dance of
             belonging, a dance of self-discovery. I was no longer an observer; I was a part of the village, a part of the rain, 
             a part of the world. And in that moment, I knew I had found not only the village's belongingness but my own place within it.  </p>
